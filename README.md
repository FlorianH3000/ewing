# Ewing vs. acute Osteomyelitis

This code has been used for both classification of healthy/normal and pathological cases as well as Ewing sarcoma vs. acute osteomyelitis.
Due to local data security and data privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be published. But the code could work as basis for other tumour classifications in x-ray images.

The code is conceptualized so that it will run and calculate a cross validation right away.
